- "NA" marked 2mm sheet file is transparent cover with SWD connector cutout, used while developing firmware, you should probably ignore it
- Mechanical design inspired by and based on [Jason Workshop](https://www.jasonworkshop.com)'s open source Q1-Lite Crystal Version Quadruped Robot. Thanks to him for the great open source work
